Keeping Templates and Documentation Up-To-Date
##############################################

Some localizers like to keep their locale up to date with the development
trunk; others like to do all the work in one go when the software nears
release. If you are of the former sort, you should watch the Bugzilla Git
repositories to catch the changes in the files.

To do so, you can subscribe to the Atom or RSS feeds that log every commit in the repositories.

Different development branches of Bugzilla are referred to by the Git source control
system in this context as ``heads``. The list of heads can be found
on `the bottom of this page <http://git.mozilla.org/?p=bugzilla/bugzilla.git;a=summary>`_ in the
"heads" section. The head named "master" is the current focus of Bugzilla development,
and the place from which the next release will come.
Click on the link of the version you want to watch. At the bottom right corner of the page that is
then displayed, you will find the RSS or Atom link to subscribe to. An so, you will be noticed for each commit
that happens on this head.
